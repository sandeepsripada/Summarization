Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 1993 after a landmark U.N. sponsored election, often clashed over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling Khmer Rouge.
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government.
