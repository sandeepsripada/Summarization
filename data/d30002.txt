Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their homes on islands near the coast. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 miles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With winds near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category 5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile (560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). "Mitch is closing in," said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast. "And God help us." Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five days. The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain "a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage." The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain areas. The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's central coast. The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone. "For that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 planes," he said. "Honduras doesn't have them." A hurricane warning was also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. In Belize, a hurricane watch was in place and the government also closed schools and sent workers home early Monday. Panic buying stripped bread from the shelves of some stores and some gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal Belize City was hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country built a new capital inland at Belmopan. Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 600 vacationers from the Island of Youth. Jerry Jarrell, the weather center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. In La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long lines at filling stations Monday to buy gasoline under a steady rain. Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood gets wet. Still, she bought only 37 cents worth _ all she could afford. "I have six children, and we live in a riverbed," she said. "If it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect of the world has in store for us." Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on Utila, had tied up his boats and was taking his family to stay with a relative on higher ground. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along Honduras' eastern coast. "Frightened people are moving into the mountains to search for shelter," he said. In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people. The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people.

Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people. Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. It also was only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles (280 kms). That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a day. "The hurricane has destroyed almost everything," said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which was within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane. "Few houses have remained standing."

Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground. Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked up huge waves that pounded seaside communities. The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early Tuesday. After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that. Caught near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. "The hurricane has destroyed almost everything," said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. "Few houses have remained standing." Honduran officials said 14 people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had died elsewhere in the country. More than 72,000 people had been evacuated to shelters. Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the region by early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to just off the coast and seemed to park there. An American was thrown from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed dead. Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding. Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephones or clean drinking water. Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana crops had been damaged "and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain." Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers) from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to crowded shelters in schools, churches and firehouses. While supplies of food and gasoline seemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long lines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took measures to limit panic buying. La Ceiba officials appealed for pure water for those in shelters and some residents set out plastic buckets to collect rainwater. Only a few hotels and offices with their own generators had electricity. Wind-whipped waves almost buried some houses near the shore. People evacuated low-lying houses by wading through chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads. In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into a ghost town. Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company was broadcasting only The Weather Channel. With the storm seemingly anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night. More than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity. Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights full. "It's been horrible," said Montgomery, as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant. "We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling. "Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed," she said dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. "Some vacation." The U.S. Agency for International Development sent two helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue and relief efforts. At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.

In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday. El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday. In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday. By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, Bolanos said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central America. EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential rains and mudslides. The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. Officials in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have died in the region. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's storm. El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported 100 storm-related deaths. The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 ecu (dlrs 480,000). the EU approved for the region on Friday. The full 6.8 million ecu (dlrs 8.18 million) will be channeled through humanitarian groups working in the region.

Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged "all public and private institutions and all men of good will" to do all they can "in this grave moment of destruction and death." Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies have been overwhelmed. Among those attending the audience were six Russian cosmonauts taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they gave John Paul a spacesuit.

Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help was growing. President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had set back Honduras' development by 50 years. He urged the more than 1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery effort. "The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children," he said. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams began searching for avalanche victims. Honduran doctors dispensed vaccinations to prevent disease outbreaks in shelters crammed with refugees. As of Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' earlier estimate of 7,000. The numbers of missing dropped from an estimated 11,000 to 4,621, Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said. "We have more access to places affected by the storm," Urbizo explained. "Until now, we have had a short amount of time and few resources to get reliable information." In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people were killed, most of those swept away when a volcano crater lake collapsed a week ago. El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its people had been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven in Costa Rica. Aid groups and governments have called for other countries to send medicine, water, canned food, roofing materials and equipment to help deliver supplies. In Washington on Thursday, President Bill Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also said Clinton was dispatching Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment to providing humanitarian relief. Hillary Rodham Clinton also will travel to the region, visiting Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. She later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continuing on to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled due to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October. Mitch, which sat off the Honduran coast for several days last week, destroyed scores of Central American communities before moving northwest. The weakened storm crossed southern Florida on Thursday, damaging mobile homes and buildings and injuring at least seven people. Countries overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just begun to calculate the damage. Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters have been set up across the Central American country. Surveyors have yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected areas _ the departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, which includes the capital. Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated number of homeless dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. Mitch damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major highways, including most spans on Highway 5, the main north-south route, officials said. Urbizo said Honduran officials hoped the scale of need in next-door Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. "Our problem is that all of the country has been affected," he said. Thursday's relief operations paled in comparison to the scope of the disaster. A total of 14 helicopter relief missions were delivering aid to stricken towns, said Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch emergency response task force. "We can manage with the number of aircraft we have because there is little to distribute," Caceres said. More help was on the way. Mexico was sending 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 475 soldiers to help in relief operations. The United States committed 19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 cargo plane. France said it was sending 250 rescue workers to Central America, along with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment. The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was diverting ships, some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donated food to Central America. It also was pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome, probably for delivery by emergency relief flights, spokesman Trevor Rowe said. "We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help people as soon as possible," Rowe said. Searches for the missing continued, and some decomposed bodies, once found, were being buried in common graves. About 100 victims had been buried around Tegucigalpa, Mayor Nahum Valladeres said. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on their backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday. Dozens of homes were swept into the river. "This is the first place we've been" with the dogs, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. "From here we'll continue searching downriver." Concerned that crowded shelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory infections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation campaign, especially for children. Doctors volunteering at a shelter housing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute said they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines from the Health Ministry. "We have to vaccinate the children," said Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections.

Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many nearby villages, residents have gone days without potable water or food. A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three days without food. Residents feared more children would die. "The worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The children are suffering, even dying," said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the parish priest. A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center in Atlanta announced. "We hope this visit will help call attention to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster has created," Carter said in a statement. U.S. President Bill Clinton requested a "global relief effort" to help Central America and boosted U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver some of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and Honduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16. Taiwan said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries are among a dwindling number of nations that recognize Taiwan, which China claims is a breakaway province. Two British ships that were in the area on an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, the Defense Ministry said Friday. "It's a coincidence that the ships are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work in an organized way," said International Development Secretary Clare Short. Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters and with their own supplies. Nicaraguan leaders previously had refused Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the means to transport or support the doctors. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, who maintained close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 rule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration.
